### TODO

- [] base the schema on the published [CloudFormation Resource Specification](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html)
- [] update for recent CloudFormation features (including ```Transform```)
- [] support YML format for templates
- [] suggest "Return Value" available on specific resource based on ```Type``` (for e.g., when constructing ```Outputs``` values)
- [] improved support for 'semantic operations' and refactoring of templates (for e.g., support renaming resources, ...) 
- [] automate plugin updates based on updates to the schema
- [] support validation of templates with the service from within the editor
- see backlog at [requirements](requirements/features.md)
