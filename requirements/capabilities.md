- Supports authoring of CloudFormation templates in JSON
- Supports validation of the template for well-formed JSON
- Highlights errors with a helpful error message (visible in the 'Problems' pane, as well as an pop-up message visible on hovering over a an highlighted element)
- Highlights missing attributes that are required at a minimum, such as:
  - a minimum of ```Resources``` top-level element required per template
  - required ```Properties``` for resource elements of a given ```Type```
- Prompts the choice of supported top-level elements (such as ```Parameters```, ```Resources```, etc.)
- Auto-completes known elements
- Auto-completes the structure of certain elements (such as ```Outputs```, ```Resources```, etc.)
- Prompts the choice of supported attributes for each element
  - for elements in the ```Parameters``` section
  - for elements in the ```Resources``` section
  - for elements in the ```Outputs``` section
- Prompts the choice of supported ```Type``` information
  - for ```Parameters```
  - for ```Resources```
- Currently relies upon a JSON schema for CloudFormation as published at [cloudformation-jsonschema](https://github.com/krishnan-mani/cloudformation-jsonschema)
